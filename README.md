#           IoT---microservices
# This is a simple tutorial for java microservices receiving IoT data from sensors.
# Tuya sensors were choosen for a single reason: very well documented
# Two different microservices frameworks will be used, just for fun, the omnipresent Spring Boot and the newborn Quarkus
#
# A brief explanation, I love technology and in a such vast terrytory the ones I love at most will be used here:
# - java
# - microservices
# - communication protocols and related subjects as message brokers an so on
# As you can see this demo will not include any kind of UI, any user screen, I confess here my total lack of knowledge about it. Here comes an invitation: anyone may contribute including a UI to this demo!
