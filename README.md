# IoT---microservices V5
This is a simple tutorial for building and running java microservices receiving and treating IoT sensor data from the field.
Just for simplification I used home automation sensors instead of IoT ones, no harm the demo.
Tuya sensors were choosen for a single reason: cheap and well documented.  
Two different microservices frameworks will be used just for fun, the omnipresent Spring Boot and the newborn Quarkus

A brief explanation, I love technology and in a such vast territory the ones I like at most and fell confortable with will be used here:
- java
- microservices
- communication protocols, message brokers and so on

The application will run into Docker containers / Kubernetes, so, it may be easily deployed to a server or even to the cloud

As you can see this demo will not include any kind of UI, any user screen, I confess here my total lack of knowledge about it. Here comes an invitation: anyone may contribute including a UI ao projeto!
